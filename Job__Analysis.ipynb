            "\n",
            "1. Years of Experience: The job description mentions a requirement of 8-10 years of experience, while you indicate that you have 1 year of experience. This suggests that you may not meet the minimum experience requirement specified in the job description.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Technical Skills: The job description mentions specific technologies and tools such as digital applications, Java, Linux, Microsoft, relational databases, message queuing, AWS cloud services, and more. While your resume includes skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks, it does not explicitly mention experience with the technologies mentioned in the job description. Additionally, knowledge of Linux and Shell scripting, as well as experience with CI/CD pipeline processes and ticketing tools like ServiceNow, are desired but not mentioned in your resume.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Relevant Experience: The job description emphasizes experience in DevOps support/Production support, change management, incident management, and database concepts.
